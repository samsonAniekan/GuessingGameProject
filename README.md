## OBJECTIVES OF PROJECT
The aim this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random.
Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. 
We've denoted the user's input with *asterisks*. All other text is produced by the computer:
